Author - Shivli Saxena<br>
I download this dataset from Kaggle, which was in .csv format. After downloading, I import the data into new excel sheet.<br>
After importing I check the header name and did some changes and make sure that the names were clean and uniform.<br>
In the age column there was one wrong value which I corrected manually.<br>
In the last the data type of Scheduled_Day and Appointment_Day was general. I convert them into date format.<br>
I customize the dates into dd-mm-yyyy format.<br>
In the last I convert neighbourhood into proper case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized by using PROPER formula [=PROPER(G2)].<br>
